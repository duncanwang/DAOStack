The HiBlock community is a great technical community in blockchain area with 12 thousands members in china. And it is well carried in my city. For Example, We've held 30 workshops every wednesday evening in 2019 which is focus on blockchain techincal share. Ever time ,we invite a specialist from a blockchain project to talk about a topic and make friend. And we have held 3 meeting up in shanghai for IOSG capital, aws blockchain this year. All of these can be demostrated in the website:http://hiblock.huodongxing.com. And the HiBlock community web site is http://www.hiblock.net.
>    Second, I'm a senior software engineer. I'm the CTO of colorbay Project which web site is www.colorbay.com. As a engineer familiar with C++, Go lanaguage, I'll know well about DAO statck and could share the right knowledge to people.
>    Third, I'm a good writer in blockchain technical propagation. I have my special column in JIANSHU,CSDN,8btc, etc. I've written more than 100 articles about ETHERUM, Smart Contract, etc.  I'll propagate DAO Stack too.
